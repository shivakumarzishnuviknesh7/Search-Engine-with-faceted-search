Agile Software Development,Prof. Dr. Englmeier,Knowing/Perceiving: Students learn basic concepts and methods of agile software development. Based on their knowledge acquired in the Bachelor course project management they better understand how to adopt the concept of Agility in Project Management. The course addresses in particular the SCRUM methodology. Applying: The students also learn tools supporting agile project management. Analyzing/Evaluating: The course applies and reflects traditional project management tools in the light of agility. This contrasts the two approaches and highlights the differences and the applicability of agility to different project settings. Synthesizing: The course trains also the use of Agile Project Management tools. The students set up a project in teams and manage their fictive work. They are encouraged to link their project management with a project they complete in a different course during the same semester.,Know Understand Apply Analyze Assess Synthesize,Basics in Project Management Agile Principles SCRUM Agile Lifecycle Measuring performance,"Lectures (2 hours/week), Exercise (2 hours/week)",Programming skills,"Highsmith, J.: ìAgile Project Management: Creating Innovative Productsî, 2nd Edition, Pearson Education/Addison Wesley Professional.
